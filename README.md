## All credits goes to kozmic who made the original PoC of CVE 2018-15133
## This is just an automation script i made while doing some lab box having this vulnerability because i didnt want to make a new deserialized object with phpggc everytime i wanted to run a different command

### Requirements:-
1. Just clone the repo
